# Add Layers - Automatic Map Reference

This is a demo Experience Builder widget. It is a version of the add-layers sample (https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/experiencebuilder/add-layers-to-a-map), but does not use a settings panel to pick the Map widget -- instead assumes there will be one map widget on the page and uses it. See the `getArbitraryFirstMapWidgetId()` function in `widget.tsx` for details.
